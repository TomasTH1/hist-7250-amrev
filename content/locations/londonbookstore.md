The Revolutionary War, surprisingly, did not change much about life in America, but one dynamic it did change were social standings. War and the military have always been an opportunity of people to rise up in society. The Revolution provided that but it also saw the destruction of some of the oldest, wealthiest families in America, forcing them to flee and leave their wealth behind. One family greatly illustrates the way in which people could both rise and fall, the Knoxs. 
The place you are standing used to be the location of Henry Konx’s bookstore, The London Bookstore. Its proximity to the Boston Commons, Old State House, and Kings Chapel illustrates how it was central to life in Boston. Here, Henry had the opportunity to  interact with people of different social classes, mainly those way above his own. Before the Siege of Boston, people of all walks of life, loyalists and patriots alike, would convene and interact in places such as this bookstore. Boston during the Revolutionary Era was practically an island, so people of all different social classes lived together in close proximity.  Working class dock workers and middle class trader merchants coexisted with the upper class on Beacon Hill. Boston was a large city in terms of population and importance, and geographically people lived close together, allowing for the spread of revolutionary ideas. Ideologically, there was a huge split between the loyalists and the patriots, and when the British invaded people on both sides quickly learned the island was not big enough for both of them. Property was destroyed, people were tarred and feathered, by all accounts Revolutionary Boston was not a stable environment. 
While the American Revolution was not a complete social revolution, things stayed more or less the same, but for some families, their position in the new nation was completely different from what it had been before the war. The Fluckers and Knoxes show both sides of that shift.

#### Henry Knox
Unlike the rest of his revolutionary peers and fellow Founding Fathers, Henry Knox was not upper class or well educated. He grew up in poverty in the same city many of his future colleagues were raised with wealth. Henry Knox was one of ten kids born to immigrant parents. His father died or left the family when Henry was nine, forcing Henry to drop out of school to care for his mother and siblings. Henry became an apprentice bookbinder and by the age of 21, Henry opened up his own store, the London Book Store. He sold an impressive selection of books from England and because of that, made a name for himself as a common destination for Boston aristocrats. Despite his proximity to the elite and his studying of their mannerisms, Henry did not have the official education his clients had. Everything he knew he had taught himself, including his vast knowledge on war and military strategy. In 1772 Henry joined the Boston Grenadier Corps, a local militia group outside of Boston. His military knowledge made it obvious to people on both sides of the growing conflict that he would be an important addition to any army. It was at the London Book Store in 1773 where Henry first met Lucky Flucker, the girl who would later become his wife.

#### Lucy Flucker 
Lucy Flucker was born into an elite, loyalist family. Her father was Thomas Flucker, the secretary of Massachusetts, and her mother was Hannah Waldo Flucker, the wealthy daughter of Brigadier General Samual Waldo, a merchant and landowner. In short, Lucy was considered loyalist ‘royalty’ in Boston. Her parents expected her to marry a nice loyalist man of equal social status. Like many women of the time, her life choices were to be predetermined by her parents, practically before she was even born. However, it would turn out to not be that simple. Lucy was an avid reader, and frequented a bookstore owned by a handsome soldier she had seen riding around town. Her and the owner, Henry quickly developed a flirtatious relationship, but had to keep it a secret as they knew her family would never allow their courtship. Lucy and Henry finally married in secret in 1974, after over a year of knowing each other. Her family was forced into an impossible situation, and they were obviously less than thrilled by the match. Thomas Flucker tried his hardest to turn his new son in law into a loyalist; he offered Henry a position in King George’s army, but Henry was a patriot. Lucy Flucker gave up everything she had when she chose to marry for love. Her family disowned her, ensuring she would never again have her family’s wealth and security. 
### During the Revolution
When the British began the Siege of Boston in April of 1775 Lucy and Henry were faced with a decision: stay in Boston and submit or flee and join the Revolution. The choice was clear. Lucy and Henry escaped to Cambridge in the middle of the night with Henry’s sword sewn into Lucy’s cape. There, Henry enlisted in the Continental Army, paving the way for his future, but for Lucy it was the final nail in the coffin for her relationship with her family, and with that her past. The war, like it did to so many families, had pitted brothers against each other, as Henry would have to fight against Lucy’s brother, a soldier in the British Army. Lucy was homeless and alone, Henry was living with the army in Cambridge, but refused to let her join him out of fear for her safety. Henry sent her alone to Worcester; a trend that continued throughout the war despite her objections.  
Henry quickly became a great military leader, rising through the ranks and working closely with General George Washington. Knox was cementing his legacy as a founding father by being present at the Battle of Bunker Hill and creating the plan behind the miracle at Dorchester Heights. Henry Knox marched to the abandoned Fort Ticonderoga in the dead of winter to transport sixty tons of cannons for more than three hundred miles over mountains and rivers. He did it all with ox-pulled sleds and managed to not lose a single cannon. It was a risky journey that only someone like Henry Knox could have pulled off.

When Henry brought the cannons back to the Boston area he fortified Dorchester Heights, a hilly area overlooking the city. The sight of that alone ended the Siege of Boston, after almost a year, without a single shot being fired.

For Lucy, watching the British flee the city was a bittersweet moment, amongst the loyalists fleeing with the British army, was her family. Lucy now had no family left in the country, except for Henry and his brother. 
As the war went on and Henry continued to prove himself, he became more and more important, travelling all over the colonies to fight for freedom. Henry urged Lucy not to join him as other wives did and to stay behind for her safety. Lucy was miserable and lonely, she was having a hard time raising her daughter alone. She tried to reconcile with the Fluckers, but no matter how many letters she sent to her family they did not want a relationship with their traitorous daughter. Lucy could not take it anymore and finally put her foot down, joining Henry in Mt. Vernon. There she took her place as the wife of a Founding Father, and developed a strong relationship with fellow wife Martha Washington. 
### After the Revolution
Henry Knox was vital to the creation of this new nation. After America won its independence from the British Empire, Henry was appointed by President Washington to serve as the nation's first Secretary of War. When the Fluckers fled, they left behind their land wealth, after the war, Lucy and Henry became the owners of their considerable landownings. Lucy and Henry hoped to live a long and peaceful life with their three remaining children, after the hardships they had faced since 1774. They did not get the chance, at the age of 56 Henry died from an infection caused by swallowing a chicken bone. Lucy had to sell the remainder of her family’s land to survive, and lived out the rest of her days alone in Maine. 


Without the War it would not have been simple for a man like Henry to raise his social status in such a profound way. The Boston that was forged during the Siege was not the same as the Boston Henry and Lucy grew up in. The population of Boston shrunk to a third of its original size during the Siege. While the war provided elevation for people such as Henry Knox, it also destroyed other Boston families. Loyalist families such as the Fluckers who were forced to flee and give up their life in America after generations. The Revolutionary War provided the opportunity for people like Henry to shake up the generational wealth and social order that existed throughout Boston, and provided some form of small scale social revolution.
