# The Boston Almshouse and the American Revolution

Boston is where the American Revolution began. It is also where the first Almshouse in the United States was founded in 1662. The rest of colonial Massachusetts followed in 1744, when the colony required all townships to create a group of men to help the poor, called the Overseers of the Poor, and to have them create Almshouses for the poor of their towns. 

The Overseers of the Poor were incredibly important figures in both the Almshouse in Boston, and in the lives of the poor in the city. 

## The American Revolution's Almshouse

Built in 1686 after the previous Almshouse burnt down, the Almshouse during the American Revolution sat on the edge of Beacon Hill and the Boston Common. In 1739, an additional Workhouse was built next to the original Almshouse. The Workhouse was different than the Almshouse, it was for the "undeserving" poor or those who had committed crimes or were generally viewed as unworthy by the Overseers, and the Almshouse was for those who were "deserving." As stated in a [volume exploring the Overseers of the Poor Records](https://primaryresearch.org/pr/dmdocuments/ootpb_almswork.pdf), "the Workhouse was intended to mark off the undeserving poor from other kinds of needy people. As sparse as the Workhouse records are for this period, they make clear the distinction between the coerced labor that served as reform for Workhouse inmates and the care and communalism offered in the Almshouse."

The Workhouse was one of the biggest buildings in Boston at that time, and was erected partially to take some of the burden off of the Almhouse, which was overcrowded.

In the American Revolutionary Era, Boston suffered unique circumstances that affected how it dealt with poverty, and as it became a social issue that the city had to confront. 

No records exist of the Boston Almshouse previous to 1733. The records of the Almshouse vary in their nature 

Children also were born in the Almshouse in the Revolutionary era, an essential aspect of the life at the Almshouse.

## Binding Out and Warning Out

While Boston may have represented the heart of Christian charity and European ideals, the actual life in the Almshouse, and those who were denied entry into the Almhouse because they were not Boston "residents" shows the darker underbelly of what it meant to be poor and have a relationship with the Almshouse and the Overseers of the Poor. While it may seem that the Workhouse for those who were "underserving" was the worst of what the Almshouse had to offer, the indenturing of children and warning out of transient people in poverty represents a darker element of what the Almshouse represented in Boston. 

The Almshouse was responsible for a variety of things, including housing adults and children if they may have them. The Overseers also conducted two more unsavory duties, which was the binding out of children to "apprenticeships" in the surrounding areas of Massachusetts, and the warning out of transient individuals who were denied housing in Boston. 

The binding out of children who had entered the Almshouse seeking help is an especially dark aspect of life in the Almshouse, and the events that occurred here. It was not uncommon for children to be bound out for long periods of time, even up to ten years. The Overseers would sign a contract with the "master" of the child that they had bound out, which can be seen below. 

The map represents the variety of individuals from families of five to individual men and women who tried to receive help from the Boston Almshouse. The map also represents the wide variety of how far many individuals came from
