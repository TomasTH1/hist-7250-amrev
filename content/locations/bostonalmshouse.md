# The Boston Almshouse and the American Revolution

Boston is where the American Revolution began. It is also where the first Almshouse in the United States was founded in 1662. The rest of colonial Massachusetts followed in 1744, when the colony required all townships to create a group of men to help the poor, called the Overseers of the Poor, and to have them create Almshouses for the poor of their towns. 

The Overseers of the Poor were incredibly important figures in both the Almshouse in Boston, and in the lives of the poor in the city. They wrote all of the rules and ran the House, as well as kept track of all of the records of admissions, and other important documentation of both daily life and overall trends of the population of the Almshouse. 

In the American Revolutionary Era, Boston suffered unique circumstances that affected how it dealt with poverty, and as it became a social issue that the city had to confront. The economic struggles that had repelled the city towards Revolution on the waterfront was intertwined with the poor and working class who were unable to work. While the Almshouse and Overseers of the Poor had been very similar to European systems, the Christian identity of Boston also played a role. 

While hardly consistent, it was a requirement of those in the Almshouse to keep with God, as well as to teach the children that lived there about Christianity. The model in Boston for dealing with poverty as a self-help motivated system with work requirements was consistent with Elizabethan England, but continued to persist and led to the creation of the Almshouse, and later on, the Workhouse. 

## The American Revolution's Almshouse

Built in 1686 after the previous Almshouse burnt down, the Almshouse during the American Revolution sat on the edge of Beacon Hill and the Boston Common. In 1739, an additional Workhouse was built next to the original Almshouse. The Workhouse was different than the Almshouse, it was for the "undeserving" poor or those who had committed crimes or were generally viewed as unworthy by the Overseers, and the Almshouse was for those who were "deserving." As stated in a [volume exploring the Overseers of the Poor Records](https://primaryresearch.org/pr/dmdocuments/ootpb_almswork.pdf), "the Workhouse was intended to mark off the undeserving poor from other kinds of needy people. As sparse as the Workhouse records are for this period, they make clear the distinction between the coerced labor that served as reform for Workhouse inmates and the care and communalism offered in the Almshouse." Eventually, the Workhouse would also serve to separate the poor that were able to work and the aged and sickly poor. Those who were able to work were put to work in the Workhouse, despite their status.

The Workhouse was one of the biggest buildings in Boston at that time, and was erected partially to take some of the burden off of the Almshouse, which was overcrowded. When the House was first built, the area around it was not significantly developed compared to the Boston waterfront, which was the hub of life in Boston at that point. The context of the Almhouse in the immediate areas and in larger Boston at that point can be seen in the images below.

The impact of the American Revolution could also be felt in the Almshouse, as large groups began to seek refuge in the House, while many were also discharged in large numbers, probably because of the swelling number of displaced individuals by the war. Despite these few large admissions, the period of the American Revolution was a quieter one for the Almshouse compared with what was to come. The drop in population from the results of the war resulted in generally less admissions in this period. As Boston's population recovered, the Almshouse admissions swelled to levels that were not manageable for the Overseers, who constantly asked for help in managing the admissions. From 1795-1801, 1,926 people were admitted. In this six year period, about the same were admitted in the thirteen years including the Revolution. 

## Life in the Almshouse 
The Boston Almshouse housed a total of 1,909 people from 1775-1788. Describing life in the Almshouse is difficult, due to the limited nature of the archival material. Much of the descriptions come from the Overseers of the Poor's accounts of the conditions. Conditions varied, with little reason as to why. The only evidence we have of bedroom conditions comes from an [inventory](https://www.colonialsociety.org/node/3087#rch08) done in 1756. Some rooms had as many as nine people in them, while some were single women. There was a division of gender unless in the case of a married couple. Still, many rooms had more people than beds in them, and were hardly safe or healthy conditions.

In the Almshouse, chores and other household duties were shared. Additionally, all residents were required to "constantly attend the Worship of God" in the house. 

In addition to required prayer, work, and the sharing of chores and beds, the Almshouse also functioned as a hospital, as many children were born in the House. From 1756 through 1767, around 82 children were born in the House. As was standard at the time, the women most likely delivered these babies in their bed or in another room of the House, maybe with assistance from other mothers that were present. The vast majority of children born in the House survived, with six being listed as born dead. In a few cases, it is clear that the mothers stayed at the Almshouse for a period after the birth of their child. Jacob Tuckerman, born to Sarah Freeman, was born August 7th 1961, and died October 10, 1963. Sarah must have remained in residence with her son for at least two years after he was born. Sarah herself entered the House May 22, 1961, when she would have been about 7 months pregnant. She was twenty two. It is unknown when she left the house, as her discharge is just listed as "Gone away." 

The transience of life, and the variety of life, in the Almshouse makes it hard to describe singularly. However, it was certainly an active, busy place that many of Boston's most needy turned to when they were in desperate need. 

## Paths in and Paths Out of the Almshouse

Because of its nature, the Almshouse in Boston was one of transience. Most individuals stayed for a few months, but some stayed for just a few days or even a few years. 

### Binding Out and Warning Out

While Boston may have represented the heart of Christian charity and European ideals, the actual life in the Almshouse, and those who were denied entry into the Almhouse because they were not Boston "residents" shows the darker underbelly of what it meant to be poor and have a relationship with the Almshouse and the Overseers of the Poor. While it may seem that the Workhouse for those who were "underserving" was the worst of what the Almshouse had to offer, the indenturing of children and warning out of transient people in poverty represents a darker element of what the Almshouse represented in Boston. 

The Almshouse was responsible for a variety of things, including housing adults and children if they may have them. The Overseers also conducted two more cruel duties, which was the binding out of children to "apprenticeships" in the surrounding areas of Massachusetts, and the warning out of transient individuals who were denied housing in Boston. 

The binding out of children who had entered the Almshouse seeking help is an especially dark aspect of life in the Almshouse, and the events that occurred here. It was not uncommon for children to be bound out for long periods of time, even up to ten years. The Overseers would sign a contract with the "master" of the child that they had bound out, which can be seen below. These bound out children were not just orphans, often they were taken from their parents and sent out, making this a particularly cruel institution enacted by the Overseers. Some accounts of the Almshouse state that its conditions were so poor, children were happy to be bound out. While some of these children may have been willing or seen opportunity in being bound out, it was certainly not their choice in all cases, and their labor was certainly unfree. 

This contract was for a girl named Abigail Hatch to a man named Henry Prentiss, which ended when Abigail turned 18. This contract is from 1778, which exemplifies how these contracts continued through the war period. While Abigail was indentured in Boston, children were sent as far as Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Warning out was another system adopted in the Almshouse as a way to turn away people from the Almshouse who were not residents of Boston. This was usually done to the poor who the House felt were "undeserving", and they were sent back to their home towns and away from Boston. 

The map below represents the variety of individuals from families of five to individual men and women who tried to receive help from the Boston Almshouse. The map also represents the wide variety of how far many individuals came from. The data for this map was derived from the first page of the  "Record book with register of admissions; and list of persons warned out of Boston, 1770-1795" from the Massachusetts Historical Society. These entries are all from 1770. As the Revolution began in Boston, impoverished people from around Massachusetts, New England, and the Great Britain attempted to get help from the Overseers in Boston.

## The End of the Almshouse
By the late 1700s, the Almshouse was in a much more crowded neighborhood in Beacon Hill, and the growing population in Boston made the current House unable to support all of the new poor who needed its services. Its proximity to the new State House was also a concern for many. In 1801, the Almshouse of the Revolution was discontinued, and a new one was opened in the West End on Leverett Street. It was more than double the size of the previous Almshouse.
