Stockbridge Indian Burial Monument, c.1900

Standing before you is a monument marking the ancestral burying place of the Muh-he-conneok peoples, known to colonists as the Mohicans, who lived in the area of Stockbridge. If the inscription could still be read, you would see "The ancient burial place of the Stockbridge Indians, 1734, the friends of our father, 1877." This is one of very few visible markers to convey to visitors the long history of indigenous occupation in the region. This lack of representation is made all the more meaningful by the fact that the Mohicans, were some of the first to fight, and die, alongside the American revolutionaries.. They were joined in their efforts by members of other indigenous nations, who were residing in Stockbridge at that time. Despite their loyalty to the rebels during the war, this diverse group of Indigenous Peoples, referred to by colonists as the “Stockbridge Indians,” would be ousted from Stockbridge almost immediately after the war’s end, commencing a decades long journey to their current location in Wisconsin.

# Becoming Rebel Allies

As the colonies expanded and hostilities between colonial powers grew, numerous Indigenous Nations found themselves in the crosshairs. Explore the map below to see where some members of the“Stockbridge Indians” were residing prior to their adoption of christianity and the founding of Stockbridge as a mission town.

The decision to create a mission town at Stockbridge came from interactions between two leaders of the Mohicans, Konkapot and Umpachenee, and the missionary John Sergeant. With his unique approach to Christianity and willingness to work with the Mohican cultural customs, Sergeant made an impression on Konkapot and Umpachenee who both converted to Christianity and encouraged their people to do so as well.

In 1735 it was agreed that the Massachusetts colony would grant ownership of land along the Housatonic River, which had previously been the territory of Konkapot and Umpachenee, to create an “Indian Town” including a mission and a school to teach Christianity and English to the Mohicans. At the time, the town was still considered “the frontier,” a place beyond colonial civilization. The Massachusetts government selected white families and forced them to resettle there in an effort to help “civilize” Mohicans (Frazier, p.39-41). By 1739 the town had been incorporated under the name of Stockbridge, and in 1751, Sergeant’s successor, Rev. Jonathan Edwards, stated in a letter:
> Here are, I suppose, about 200 _Indians_, old and young, of the
proper _Stockbridge-Indians_ and of late a considerable number of the Mohawks have come hither from their own country (about 80 Miles N. W. from hence) to be instructed.

It was clear Stockbridge was successful, and the “Stockbridge Indians” were committed to the town. This commitment to living in peace with the white colonists is made evident by their involvement in several wars prior to the American Revolution. In King Philip’s War (1675 – 1676) the “Stockbridge Indians” remained neutral rather than supporting other Indigenous Tribes. Later during King George’s War (1744 – 1748) they supported the English, which they did again during The French and Indian War (1754 – 1763).

Early on the “Stockbridge Indians” held important positions in the town. Konkapot and Umpachenee helped select the town government after incorporation (Frazier, p. 47). However, after the French and Indian War more white colonists began to settle in the town and land issues began to arise (Calloway, p. 89). Historian Bryan Rindfleisch suggests that along with the pressure of living in a town which supported the Sons of Liberty, the lack of English support for the “Stockbridge Indians” during these land disputes may have had a hand in their decision to side with the rebels. (Rindfleisch).

# Joining the Revolution
In July 1774 on the eve of the Revolution, 60 delegates from around the Berkshires met in Stockbridge to protest the tea tax and agree on a boycott of British goods (Frazier, p. 193). According to local lore, this meeting took place at a tavern still in operation today, The Red Lion Inn. This is reflected both by [the Inn](https://www.redlioninn.com/history) and by the Stockbridge-Munsee band of Mohicans in their [Walking-Tour of Main Street](https://www.nativeamericantrail.org/stockbridge-walking-tour/).

While “Stockbridge Indians” joined the militia directly serving at the Siege of Boston and in numerous later battles, one of their biggest contributions was diplomacy (Schmidt, p.121). Their Location in a “frontier region” close to the non-Christianized nations allowed for the “Stockbridge Indians” to operate in both worlds.  A letter from the Virginia Gazette in 1775 recounts:
>A firm foundation now turns up to view, for the influence of the Stockbridge Indians among the six nations, and matters stand well with the Canadian Indians… The Canadian Indians farther told our Indians, that if they did fight at all they would fight against the regulars.

Below is a list of names of the “Stockbridge Indians” who joined the Revolutionary War, courtesy of the Stockbridge Archives. On the list are Abram Nauaumptonky and William Notonksin, who in 1775 would become the first two indigenous men to die in the revolution, having been mistakenly shot by American soldiers during a skirmish with the British near Cambridge (Frazier, p.200).

![List of Stockbridge Indians in Revolutionary War](https://d2jv02qf7xgjwx.cloudfront.net/accounts/317840/images/Stockbridge_Militia_List_Large.jpg)

Another notable name is Hendrick Aupaumut, who would become a captain of the militia. In a [letter from George Washington to Aupaumut](https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-21-02-0283) in July of 1779 he states:
>This is to declare that from the good opinion I have of your bravery and attachment to the United States of America, I approve … that you shall have and receive the pay of a Captain... every private man in your company, while they are in the said service shall have & receive the same pay and allowance of provisions, as the Soldiers employed in the Army.

Both of these letters make clear the value placed on the “Stockbridge Indians” involvement and support during the war. At the time gratitude was shown by granting them equal pay with white militiamen, however, in the post-war period memory of this gratitude was short-lived.

# Post-War Displacement

In the immediate aftermath of the Revolution, appreciation was expressed directly by George Washington in the form of an ox roast in 1783, but even then, the “Stockbridge Indians” were becoming outsiders in their own town. In 1783, only two selectmen were indigenous men, and by 1784 there were none. By the following year the majority of the “Stockbridge Indians” had relocated to NY to live with the Oneida forming New Stockbridge (Calloway, p. 100-102). But again, the NY government was pressuring Indigenous Peoples to leave the state and by the 1790s problems had arisen again. In a narrative of his diplomatic work with western Indigenous Nations Hendrick Aupaumut notes:
>In all my arguments with these Indians, I have as it were oblige to say nothing with regard of the conduct of Yorkers, how they cheat my fathers, how they taken our lands Unjustly, and how my fathers were groaning as it were to their graves, in losing their lands for nothing, although they were faithful friends to the Whites” (Historical Society of Penn., p.128)

It seems clear that despite the ongoing loyalty of the “Stockbridge Indians” and Aupaumut’s continued diplomatic work, the new US government was unconcerned with reciprocating any assistance. By the early 1800s, the “Stockbridge Indians” had moved again to Indiana, only to find out the land had already been taken. They eventually settled in Wisconsin in 1822, where their descendants remain today, over 1100 miles away from the town their ancestors founded ([Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohicans]( https://www.mohican.com/brief-history/)). An 1855 Map of Stockbridge shows almost no trace of the Mohicans who started the town.

# Acknowledgement, Reclamation, & The Future
Acknowledgement of the “Stockbridge Indians” role in the revolution has never been forgotten by scholars but has also not been widely spread to the public in the ways that other aspects of the Revolution have. In the town of Stockbridge you can visit the additional sites below:

![Konkapot's Grave](https://d2jv02qf7xgjwx.cloudfront.net/accounts/317840/images/Konkapot_Grave_Large.jpg)

The grave of Konkapot, with a dedication to other "Housatonic Indians".

The Children's Chime Tower, Library of Congress, 2019. The plaque above the door reads "*This Memorial Tower marks the spot where stood the Little Church in the wilderness in which John Sergeant preached to the Stockbridge Indians in 1739.*"

![Mission House Museum](https://thetrustees.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/BR_MH_front_SSheppard-608x0-c-default.jpg)

The Mission House, built by John Sergeant c.1742. Now a museum with artifacts from the "Stockbridge Indians."

In their town there is no monument to their service and sacrifice, but in NY a 1906 monument marks the mass grave of fallen “Stockbridge Indians” in Van Cortlandt Park, and a statue of Daniel Nimham, a Wappinger sachem and Stockbridge Militia leader, was erected in Fishkill in 2020. 

Most notably the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia has no permanent information about the “Stockbridge Indians” though they have named exhibit halls to honor the Oneida who were also allies in the war.

There has been continued and increasing involvement in the town by the Stockbridge-Munsee who are working to preserve the history. Their work has included:
- An interactive [Walking-Tour of Main Street](https://www.nativeamericantrail.org/stockbridge-walking-tour/) calling attention to important places and people. 
- An exhibit at the Mission House Museum entitled “Our Lands, Our Home, Our Heart / Nda’keenã , Weekeyaak , Nda’anã” 
- [Archaeological surveys](https://www.mohican.com/mt-content/uploads/2024/04/tribal-archaeology-in-stockbridge-ma.pdf), to uncover prominent locations, such as the site of the 1739 meeting house.
- A [webinar series](https://www.mohican.com/2024-winter-webinar-series/) of their on-going work.

Perhaps the biggest achievement was the [2023 grant to purchase back 351 acres of ancestral land in Stockbridge](https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/08/31/stockbridge-munsee-mohicans-berkshires-land-monument-mountain-grants).  The future may see a much bigger presence of the Stockbridge-Munsee band of Mohicans in the area, but as the 250th anniversary of the country nears, the role of the “Stockbridge Indians” should be honored.
